              <p>I have never been the best at cooking or making sure what I am eating is even edible. That is why I use services such as doordash and uber eats a lot. I have learned that there are many other reasons why college students also order from these apps. I made made a survey asking many questions about different features of the app and how the user expirence is for that customer. Through this I learned there are many ways that the user expirence can be improved upon.</p></div>

            <p> To better understand the design question, I sent out a survey to many college students to figure out the main pain points of the app. I also wanted to gather data to see if some features can be relocated or possibly even elimniated based on how often they get used. My results are a lot how I expected them to be. </p>

    <p> From this data I gathered, you can see that some of the user experience and interface needs to be redesigned. Specifically with the "pick-up" option, search menu, and ordering items other than food. I made sure to add a "N/A" option for those who would not have experienced the certain issue.
        <br> <br>You can see from the results that no one that took the survey has every used the pick-up option or has ordered something other than food on the app. I want to redesign the app to still have these options available, but have them take up less space than the current design. Later in this page you will see how I redesigned the interface to increase the user experience in these target areas. </p>

              <p>Here I show what the current landing page looks like. You can see that is is crowded up by the icons in the beginning, this is where a search menu should be. You can also see that the restaurants are cut off, this can look better if there was less horizontal scrolling.</p>

           <h2>Redesign #1</h2>
                <br>
              <p>In this redesign you can see I added a search bar to the top of the app to easily find a restaurant. I also made the restaurants in a vertical fashion so the images are not cut off and you can clearly see your options. You can see the stars I added to two of the choices. These are for your favorites so you can find them easier. The last thing I changed is in the navigation bar at the bottom. I removed the pick-up option and left it at the top. This cleans the nav bar up and makes the whole design look cleaner.</p>

              <p>At the end of the day the doordash app has all the right features to be a successful app. However, on the flip side the app is poorly designed and is confusing to customers and could be made more intuitive. Through my user research I found that customers had a hard time locating specific restaurants and ordering items from a menu. To improve these features I cleaned up the interface for the landing page and the menus by simplifying the text and adding more white space. For the landing page, I limited the amount of horizontal scrolling to improve visibility. By implementing these changes the user experience was enhanced and lessen the pain points. </p>
